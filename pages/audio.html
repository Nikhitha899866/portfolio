                        <div>In a crowded bar, a man and his friends are drinking and laughing. The man wants
                            to leave, and he says, "See you later." Another person in the group says, "Bye,"
                            but in a funny voice, which makes everyone laugh again. This person leaves the
                            place and whistles as he walks to his car. He opens the door to his car and after
                            sitting he close the door. He is drunk and didn't put his seat belt on before
                            starting the car . After he starts the car, his phone rings, and he observes it
                            instead of at the road. This causes the car to skid first and due to hand break fails
                            the car crashes. People near by rush to help him because the person got hurt
                            and moaning on the inside. Right away, the police and an ambulance arrive. The
                            person will have a hard time breathing, and they will take him into ambulance and
                            starts minor treatment , but his heartbeat rises up, and he cant able to breath
                            and respond to treatment, the ECG monitor sounds that the heart beat has been
                            stoped and he passes away in the ambulance itself. </div>

                                First, I picked some happy music, cut out the part I wanted, and added
                                fade-in and fade-out effects to the beginning and end.

                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                Once I've gotten all the sounds I need for a bar, like the sound of a bottle being
                                opened, people laughing, the sound of drinking alcohol, and some background
                                laughter, I'll placed them in and arranged all together.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                I kept them on three separate channels and set them up so that they sound
                                good together.I applied silence for unrequired sound to stop when it wasn't
                                needed, added pitch and tempo effects, and changed them as needed.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                Again, I've recorded & collected some different sounds, such as a person
                                walking and whistling, a car door opening and closing, a ringtone, and a hand
                                break.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                I also put this in different channels and took out some sounds I didn't
                                like, merged them together, and used the envelop tool, which is needed
                                for some high-rise sounds.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                The rest of the car crash sounds have been edited and mixed together,
                                and the sounds of the ambulance and heartbeat have been put on
                                different channels,to show the different modules of sound given
                                different effects, and changed the audio settings.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                Finally, I went through all of the sounds and made different changes
                                to them. I also moved some sounds to different channels, where I
                                edited the sound modes to make the left and right sounds louder and
                                quieter, and added the necessary effects.
